# ðŸ¦€ RUST NES ðŸ¦€
AkeemKaleeb's Take on an emulator for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) built in Rust.

The code features a working CPU and will eventually feature a PPU, APU, and a complete IO system.
The purpose of this emulator is to learn Rust and add to my portfolio of projects. 
It relies on the SDL2 Crate created for Rust and allows for ROMs in the .nes format to be run.
