// Each cartridge carried at least two large ROM chips - the Character ROM (CHR ROM) and the Program ROM (PRG ROM). 
// The former stored a game's video graphics data, the latter stored CPU instructions - the game's code
// The later version of cartridges carried additional hardware (ROM and RAM) accessible through so-called mappers.
